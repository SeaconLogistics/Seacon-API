## SEACON API Documentation
#### v20190130

### Introduction

Seacon prefers to have direct system-integration with its customers and suppliers. There are several options how we can do this. This document describes the technical details on how the integration can be done and what formats are preferred by Seacon.

### Integration	- Method of data transfer

Seacon uses an [Enterprise Service Bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus) (ESB) to integrate systems. Using this ESB we can use various methods of communication. We can use the most common communication methodologies to get and send EDI data between Seacon and it's customers. (E.g.  ftp(s) / http(s) / soap / AS2 etc.).  
Our preferred communication is POST-ing the data over http(s) through a Firewall-protected connection. Using this method, we can reply to the message as it is being sent that the content was accepted and communication has succeeded.  For setting this up we will provide the customer with an endpoint where they can POST their messages to. as an extra security feature, only pre-specified ip addresses are allowed to post to the endpoint.   
Exactly which method for communication will be used will be discussed with the customer or supplier on a case-by-case basis.

### EDI Messages

Seacon can convert between various EDI formats (E.g. EDIFACT / csv / fixed length / xml).
All Implementations require the files supplied by the second party to be mapped to the Seacon standard formats, this includes translations and conversions. (e.g. country codes, date formats, status messages, ect.)
The time needed for mapping this depends on the complexity of the implementation and any limitations from the connection party's systems.
Since the ESB internally uses XML files, it is preferred to receive the customer files in that format to lessen the steps needed for translation.  
It’s also possible to make use of the Seacon standard messages. These are described below.


### New Customer Procedure

Seacon follows the following steps when connecting up new EDI connections with you, our customer or supplier.

1. The Integration Engineer will discuss the types of messages to be set and the requirements for each message type.
1. Both your and Seacon's firewalls need to be configured to allow the required connections.
1. Once the firewall changes have been implemented the connection can be tested using the [Seacon Echo Service](#seacon-echo-service)
1. from this point on the [Seacon Validator](#validate-with-seacon-validator) can be used to test the validity of xml messages generated by your system.
1. after the connection has been successfully established we can then also test the actual integration with our backend system, Seacon has a test environment available where messages can be sent to for testing purposes. Seacon will provide test url's where test messages can be sent to.
1. after a successful testing phase and acceptance of both parties the messages may be sent to the Production url which will be provided.
1. when transitioning from an existing communication method (email, fax, carrier pigeon or other method) we will maintain a short period of overlap where both methods will be used as an additional verification.

`xmllint --schema status-flat.xsd status-complete-65101.xml`  


### Validate with Seacon Validator
to Test the valid XML, post the xml to the Seacon Validator  
`http://webservice.seaconlogistics.com:8000/validate?validate=status-message-65101-flat`



### Seacon Echo Service
To test your connection to the Seacon Webservice please POST a test file to the following URL.

##### Production server:

###### Unencrypted traffic
`http://webservice.seaconlogistics.com:9000/echo`

###### Encrypted traffic
`https://webservice.seaconlogistics.com:9001/secho/`


##### Test server:

###### Unencrypted traffic
`http://webservice.seaconlogistics.com:8000/echo`

###### Encrypted traffic
`https://webservice.seaconlogistics.com:8001/secho/`

#### Sample Commands

`curl -X POST http://webservice.seaconlogistics.com:8000/echo`

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data "Hallo Seacon, dit is een test" http://webservice.seaconlogistics.com:8000/echo`



### More information:
With every customer or supplier we will discuss what will be the most efficient way to connect the systems. It could be the usage of the “Seacon standard” files, but there are of course other options. We have a lot op options in connecting.
