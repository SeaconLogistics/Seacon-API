### New Customer Procedure

Seacon follows the following steps when connecting up new EDI connections with you, our customer or supplier.

1. The Integration Engineer will discuss the types of messages to be set and the requirements for each message type.
1. Both your and Seacon's firewalls need to be configured to allow the required connections.
1. Once the firewall changes have been implemented the connection can be tested using the [Seacon Echo Service](#seacon-echo-service)
1. from this point on the [Seacon Validator](#validate-with-seacon-validator) can be used to test the validity of xml messages generated by your system.
1. after the connection has been successfully established we can then also test the actual integration with our backend system, Seacon has a test environment available where messages can be sent to for testing purposes. Seacon will provide test url's where test messages can be sent to.
1. after a successful testing phase and acceptance of both parties the messages may be sent to the Production url which will be provided.
1. when transitioning from an existing communication method (email, fax, carrier pigeon or other method) we will maintain a short period of overlap where both methods will be used as an additional verification.
